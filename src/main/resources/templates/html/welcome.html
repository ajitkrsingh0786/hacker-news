            <b>Welcome to Hacker News</b>
            <br><br>
            <p id="welcomeP">
                HN is an experiment.  As a rule, a community site that becomes
                popular will decline in quality.  Our hypothesis is that this is not
                inevitable&mdash;that by making a conscious effort to resist
                decline, we can keep it from happening.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap
                links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                A crap link is one that's only superficially
                interesting. Stories on HN don't have to be
                about hacking, because good hackers aren't only interested in hacking,
                but they do have to be deeply interesting.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                What does "deeply interesting" mean?  It means stuff that teaches you
                about the world.  A story about a robbery, for example, would
                probably not be deeply interesting.  But if this robbery was a sign
                of some bigger, underlying trend, perhaps it could be.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                The worst thing to post or upvote is something that's
                intensely but shallowly interesting: gossip about famous people,
                funny or cute pictures or videos, partisan political articles, etc.
                If you let <ax href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_perch">that</a>
                sort of thing onto a news site, it will push
                aside the deeply interesting stuff, which tends to be quieter.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                The most important principle on HN, though, is to make thoughtful
                comments.  Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your
                comment teach us anything?  There are two ways to do that: by
                pointing out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned,
                and by giving more information about the topic, perhaps from personal
                experience.  Whereas comments like "LOL!" or worse still, "That's
                retarded!" teach us nothing.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                Empty comments can be ok if they're positive.  There's nothing wrong
                with submitting a comment saying just "Thanks."  What we especially
                discourage are comments that are empty and negative&mdash;comments
                that are mere name-calling.
            <p id="welcomeP">
                Which brings us to the most important principle
                on HN: civility.  Since long before the web, the anonymity of online
                conversation has lured people into being much ruder than they'd
                be in person.  So the principle here is: don't say anything
                you wouldn't say face to face.  This doesn't mean you can't disagree.
                But disagree without calling names.
                If you're right, your argument will be more convincing without them.
